          <p className="copy">
            Coiin Reward Points are a part of the in-app ledger system that is used in the Services and have no
            “real-world” monetary value.
          </p>
          <p className="copy">
            Coiin Reward Points are not your property. You can&apos;t transfer points to any other person or program
            account. Additionally, points can&apos;t be transferred by operation of law, such as by inheritance, in
            bankruptcy or in connection with a divorce.
          </p>
          <p className="copy">
            A user cannot remove or transfer Coiin from their account, provided that, for clarity: (a) as discussed
            further below, we may remove Coiin from a user’s account in connection with the termination or suspension of
            their access to the Services, and (b) Coiin may be transferred by the Company from one account to another in
            connection with account migration, where permitted by the Company, in its sole discretion. If not withdrawn,
            Coiin will “expire” and be removed from a user’s account after two (2) years from the last earning or
            withdrawal activity within an account. Additionally, upon termination of a user’s account, any and all Coiin
            associated with a user’s account will be automatically and irrevocably removed and deleted.
          </p>
          <p className="copy">
            A company who deposits Coiin from their account into Raiinmaker agrees to the following: (a) we may remove
            their credits at any time, and (b) Coiin may be transferred in and out of their wallet Raiinmaker deems fit.
            Raiinmaker has full discretion to move, transfer, repossess, credit, or modify Coiin balances as desired.

          <p className="big-title">Raiinmaker Rewards System</p>
          <p className="title">How It Works</p>
          <p className="copy">
            Raiinmaker members earn Coiin reward points that are distributed upon the end of a marketing campaign. The
            amount is based upon a user influence score in relation to the influence score of all participating users,
            against the total amount of Coiin reward points staked to the enrolled marketing campaign. Raiinmaker
            members terms and conditions and user agreement can be found
            <a href="https://www.raiinmaker.com/terms/"> here</a>.
          </p>
          <p className="copy">
            The user influence score earns a point for every digital value interaction tracked for the life span of an
            eligible campaign, depending on the weighted earn rate determined by the enrolled marketing campaign. As a
            brand, you can set the amount of rewards in a given campaign when creating a campaign.{' '}
          </p>

          <p className="title">Campaign Creation System </p>
          <p className="copy">
            Brands are able to create marketing campaigns. These campaigns are then checked by Raiinmaker and approved
            or denied on any basis whatsoever. Rainmaker can reject, approve, remove, or change your campaign at any
            time. Rainmaker can make edits and changes as desired as well.
          </p>

          <p className="title">Tiering System </p>
          <p className="copy">
            Participants of campaigns are eligible to earn additional points provisioned by a campaign which will be
            based on the user’s influence score.
          </p>

          <p className="title">Updates</p>
          <p className="copy">
            Raiinmaker may modify, alter, delete or add new terms and conditions for marketing campaigns, data metrics,
            the reward program or the application/services at any time without notice. For Raiinmaker this includes, but
            is not limited to, modifying, altering, adding or deleting redemption levels, conversion ratios, conditions
            for status, conditions for membership and conditions for earning incentives or rewards, at any time without

            Raiinmaker’s rewards program, at any time without notice. Raiinmaker can reject or approve any campaign at

            be different than the actual payment the Supplier receives. The amount You are charged is a fee for services
            and covers the costs of Your redemption. The charge for taxes and fees varies based on a number of factors,
            including but not limited to, (1) how much payment the Supplier receives, and (2) the location of the
            Supplier where you will be staying(?). Fees also may include profit for the Supplier. Coiin

          </p>
          <p className="copy">
            (1) If you have received payments of $599 during a tax year, your account will be suspended (i.e., you will
            not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or participate in marketing
            campaigns) for the remainder of the applicable tax year unless and until you provide Raiinmaker with a
